<p>Let's consider a project containing a module written in C... How to proceed in this case when we want to manage everything by the same way, compile from Gradle and version in a Maven repository?</p>
<p>This article describes an easy way how to achieve this tough DevOps goal.</p><h2>Building non-java resources with Gradle <br /></h2>
<p>For building non-java sources there is a package of plugins for dealing with native binaries, this package is currently under incubating but seems to be pretty usable so far.</p>
<p>Details can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/nativeBinaries.html" title="Building native binaries">Building native binaries</a> chapter of the official documentation. <a href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/nativeBinaries.html" title="Building native binaries"><br /></a></p>
<p>There is a support for several languages like C, C++, Assembly, Windows resources, ...</p>
<p>We will focus on C here, as the language differences are not the point of our issue.</p>
<h3>C builds with Gradle</h3>
<p>Applying the &quot;c&quot; Gradle plugin with a simple setting of source codes located in <code>src/main/c</code> and <code>src/main/c/headers</code> in the project folder:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">apply plugin: 'c'

executables {
&nbsp; main { }
}

sources {
&nbsp; main {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; srcDir "src/main/c"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include "**/*.c"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exportedHeaders {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; srcDir "src/main/c/headers"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include "**/*.h"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
}</pre>
<p> This script will simply compile the sources in the source path and put the result (.exe file) into <code>build/binaries/mainExecutable</code> folder.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the documentation (mentioned above).</p>
<h2>Publish non-java resources into a Maven2 repository</h2>
<p>For publishing we need to have an access to a Maven2 repository, for instance <a href="http://www.sonatype.org/nexus" target="_blank" title="Nexus server">the Nexus server from Sonatype</a>.</p>
<p>The goal here is to <strong>version the binaries in the repository</strong>, and what's more - we would like to make <strong>different variants of binaries</strong> (for instance each variant for a different platform).</p>
<p>Using the Gradle <a title="Maven Publishing plugin" target="_blank" href="https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html">Maven Publishing plugin</a> is a pretty straightforward way to do this:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">apply plugin: 'maven-publish'

group = 'cz.net21.ttulka'
version = '0.1'

task myZip(type: Zip) {
&nbsp; destinationDir = file('dist')
&nbsp; archiveName 'myC.zip'
&nbsp; from 'build/binaries/mainExecutable'
}

publishing {
&nbsp; publications {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myPublicationName(MavenPublication) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artifact (myZip) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classifier = 'win32'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
}

repositories {
&nbsp; maven {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; credentials {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; username 'xxx'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password 'xyz'
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; url 'http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/MyMavenRep1/'
&nbsp; }
}
</pre>
<p>Don't forget to set the project name in the <code>settings.gradle</code> configuration file, for instance:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">rootProject.name = 'my-project-with-native-binaries'</pre>
<p>In the example snippet we have used the <code>Zip </code>Gradle task to archive the binaries into a zip file, then we have used the archive as the input for the Maven publication and finally added the classifier (<code>classifier = 'win32'</code>) to annotate this build variant as a Win32 platform-oriented. </p>
<h2>Load the binaries as a dependency in an independent project</h2>
<p>As far as we have compiled the sources and put the binaries into the repository, we want to deal with them from another project (or a different module).</p>
<p> To distinguish the binary dependencies from the others, we can define a new Gradle configuration:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">configurations {
&nbsp; binaries {}
}</pre>
<p>Dependencies are then marked by this configuration flag, don't forget that we used the zip archive and the classifier:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">dependencies {
&nbsp; binaries 'cz.net21.ttulka:my-project-with-native-binaries:0.1:win32@zip'
}</pre>
<p>That's it, now we can do whatever we want:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">// copy the dependencies into a 'deps' folder
task getDeps(type: Copy) {
&nbsp; from configurations.binaries
&nbsp; into 'deps/'
}</pre>
<p> <br /></p>
<p>Hopefully this article gave you a little insight how to deal with different types of resources in one unified way with Gradle, and help you optimize your DevOps processes!<br /></p>
