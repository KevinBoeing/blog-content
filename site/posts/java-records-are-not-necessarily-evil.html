<p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/records-come-to-java" target="_blank">Records</a> are likely the most discussed feature new in Java 14. At the same time, there is a lot of criticism due to their non-object-oriented nature. A typical argument says that records are a concept from procedural programming and have no place in an object-oriented language.</p>

<p>Do records really encourage procedural rather than object thinking?</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. I totally agree that records are no object-oriented feature, on the other hand, I believe there are valid use-cases for them even in perfectly object-oriented applications.</p>

<p>The reason is, there are no true <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/05/31/AttheBoundaries,ApplicationsareNotObject-Oriented/" target="_blank">objects at the boundaries</a>. Consider for instance a REST resource, database entity or configuration properties. Those are all mere data structures, but still need to have their representations in Java code.</p>

<h2>Evolution of Records</h2>

<p>Of course, we have data structure types such as <code class="is kd ke kf kg b">Map</code> or <code class="is kd ke kf kg b">Set</code> in Java, and they are sufficient for a lot of cases. Sometimes, however, it is beneficial to have a typed data structure — for declarative validations, marshaling or mapping, for example. Traditionally, the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html" target="_blank">Data Transfer Objects (DTO)</a> are used in such scenarios:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
class AccountData {

  private String username;
  private String password;
  private String email;

  public AccountData(
      String username, String password, String email) {
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
    this.email = email;
  }
  public String getUsername() {
    return username;
  }
  public void setUsername(String username) {
    this.username = username;
  }
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }
  public void setPassword(String password) {
    this.password = password;
  }
  public String getEmail() {
    return email;
  }
  public void setEmail(String email) {
    this.email = email;
  }
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) {
      return true;
    }
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) {
      return false;
    }
    AccountData that = (AccountData) o;
    return username.equals(that.username) &&
        password.equals(that.password) &&
        email.equals(that.email);
  }
  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(
        username, password, email);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Well, this is really a lot of boilerplate code for such a simple thing. You can hate it, you can love it, but <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Data" target="_blank">Lombok</a> is addressing exactly this gap quite elegantly:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@Data
class AccountData {

  private String username;
  private String password;
  private String email;
}
</pre>

Lombok is based on code-manipulations, which could be seen as inadequate “black magic” a lot of developers don’t want to have in their codebases. Java 14 solves this problem with the records:

<pre class="brush: java">
record AccountData (
    String username,
    String password,
    String email) {}
</pre>

Any resemblance to Kotlin’s data classes is purely coincidental:

<pre class="brush: java">
data class AccountData (
    var username: String,
    var password: String,
    var email: String)
</pre>

<h2>The Problem with DTOs</h2>

<p>So, what’s the problem here? Java records seem to introduce DTOs as a language feature. What’s the problem with DTOs? The “O” is. The <strong>Data Transfer Objects are no objects at all!</strong> A DTO is just a typed data structure.</p>

<p>Code should be as explicit as possible and data structures should not be called objects. This fallacy leads to a bad object design, usually to the infamous <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html" href="_blank">Anemic Domain Model</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, records (and even the Lombok’s <code>@Data</code> annotation) have no "object" in the name. Records make it explicit, <a href="/treat-data-as-data" href="_blank">data is treated as data</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Java records are a new feature that brings an additional data structure type into the language. In contrast to DTOs, <strong>records make data structures in code explicit</strong>. They are right tools for right purposes. Being used incorrectly they are evil servants like everything else could be, too.</p>

<p>There are much more dangerous common practices in Java such as null references, static methods and global constants, but that’s a different story...</p>

<p>Happy recording!</p>
