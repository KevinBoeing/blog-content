<h2>Microservices Anatomy</h2>
<p>Let's simply define a microservice as an <strong>autonom service built from one or more resources</strong>. The resource mean functionality (functions*), storage (database), communication (message topic), etc. All the service needs must be included in the stack or given as a parameter (environment variable), API is exposed and besides are all the resource private for the microservice. One microservice &hArr; one stack &hArr; one deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>According the Single Responsibility Principle a component should do one and only one thing. Applying this rule to the functions level we get a function for an action. Let's consider a simple CRUD microservice; all the CRUD operation are represented by simple functions:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-code-samples/master/nodejs-crud-microservice/doc/FunctionSeparation-Product-Service-Overview.png" width="50%" /></p>

<p>How does this look like from the dev-ops point of view? We can create a new project artifact for every function. Such code is <strong>easy to reason about, easy to test and deploy</strong>. The last one could be written with a question mark, of course it's easy to deploy a function, but don't forget there must be pipeline actions for build, deploy and test execution which is really only doing, but it's a strenuous and boring job and brings additional complexity.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/FunctionSeparation-pipeline.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Similar for the codebase. Take a look at this simple AWS Lambda function in Node.js:</p>

<pre>
.gitignore
gruntfile.js
jasmine.json
package.json
package-lock.json
README.md
</pre>

<p>As you can see there several files only to set up the module. This must be multiplied for every function.</p>

<p>So, a function for an action sounds well in theory but in practise it could be an overkill.</p>

<h2>Modularization 'till the last step</h2>
<p><strong>Decoupling</strong> is propably the most important concept in the design of software systems. So we never surrender this principle. Anyway we can distinguish between logical and physical coupling. <strong>Two modules can be perfectly decoupled even while physically existing in a same artifact</strong> - when they have no shared code and dependencies only to APIs (following principles of hexagonal architecture).</p>

<p>Let's consider the following implementation of the CRUD microservice:</p>

<pre>
src/
   index.js
   list-products.js
   get-product.js
   create-product.js
   update-product.js
   remove-product.js
</pre>

<p><code>index.js</code></p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">
const list = require('./list-products').handler
const get = require('./get-product').handler
const create = require('./create-product').handler
const update = require('./update-product').handler
const remove = require('./remove-product').handler

exports.handler = async function(event) {
    if (!event || !event.resource || !event.httpMethod) {
        return buildResponse(400, {error: 'Wrong request format.'})
    }

    if (event.resource === '/') {

        switch (event.httpMethod) {
            case 'GET':
                return await list(event)
            case 'POST':
                return await create(event)
            default:
                return buildResponse(405, {error: 'Wrong request method.'})
        }
    }
    else if (event.resource === '/{id}') {

        switch (event.httpMethod) {
            case 'GET':
                return await get(event)
            case 'PUT':
                return await update(event)
            case 'DELETE':
                return await remove(event)
            default:
                return buildResponse(405, {error: 'Wrong request method.'})
        }
    } else {
        return buildResponse(404, {error: 'Resource does not exist.'})
    }
}

function buildResponse(statusCode, data = null) {
    return {
        isBase64Encoded: false,
        statusCode: statusCode,
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    }
}
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the main handler is only a router to other functions, which look like following:</p>

<p><code>get-product.js</code></p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">
const AWS = require('aws-sdk')

const PRODUCT_TABLE = process.env.PRODUCT_TABLE

const dynamoDb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({apiVersion: '2012-08-10'})

exports.handler = async function(event) {
    if (!event || !event.httpMethod) {
        return buildResponse(400, {error: 'Wrong request format.'})
    }
    if (event.httpMethod !== 'GET') {
        return buildResponse(405, {error: 'Wrong request method - only GET supported.'})
    }
    if (!event.pathParameters || !event.pathParameters.id) {
        return buildResponse(400, {error: 'Wrong request - parameter product ID must be set.'})
    }

    try {
        const response = await dispatch(event.pathParameters.id)
        if (response) {
            return buildResponse(200, response)
        } else {
            return buildResponse(404, {error: 'Product was not found.'})
        }

    } catch (ex) {
        console.error('ERROR', JSON.stringify(ex))
    }
}

async function dispatch(id) {
    const product = getProduct(id)
    return product
}

async function getProduct(id) {
    const params = {
        TableName: PRODUCT_TABLE,
        Key: { productId: id }
    }
    const res = await dynamoDb.get(params).promise()

    return (res.Item)
        ? { id: res.Item.productId,
            name: res.Item.name,
            description: res.Item.description,
            price: res.Item.price }
        : null
}

function buildResponse(statusCode, data = null) {
    return {
        isBase64Encoded: false,
        statusCode: statusCode,
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The Single Responsibility Principle is applied here. The function has its own handler which takes care of the incoming HTTP request. All the HTTP-related checks and transformations must be done here. The handler is the only one place for such a dirty code. After the request is checked, dispatching is executed. This is something like a main method, an entry point to the business logic. In this case just getting the product details.</p>

<p>And other functions in the same spirit...</p>

<p>The actions are decoupled from each other and are ready to be separated into individual functions in the next last step. But staying here we still have a very clear code easy to test and reason about and we don't need to adapt the pipeline onto this level of granularity.</p>

<h2>Test it!</h2>
<p>It's very easy to test a service built in this way. We write a Unit Test Suite for every action (exported function), an Integration Test Suite for the service API (index.js) and End-to-End Test Suite for the Gateway API facade.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

<hr/>
<p>* <em>Functions are sometimes called "nanoservices" as they are smaller than microservices. Actually, I don't even like the term "microservice" because it confuses people regarding its size ("How small should a microservice be?"), so I don't like to develop this terminology on in the same manner.</em>
