<p>Transducers are composable reducers. A transducer takes a reducer and returns another reducer. Transducers compose via simple function composition. But, there is a tiny difference between function and transducer composition: functions compose bottom-to-top while transducers top-to-bottom.</p>

<h2>Function Composition</h2>

<p>First of all we discuss the basics: <em>function composition</em>.</p>
<p>Function composition is the process of chaining the output of a function to the input of another function. In algebra, composition of functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> means <code>(f&nbsp;&sdot;&nbsp;g)(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(g(x))</code>.</p>
<p>In JavaScript we can write:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const inc = (x) =&gt; x + 1;
const double = (x) =&gt; x * 2;

const incAndDouble = (x) =&gt; double(inc(x)); // compound function

incAndDouble(2); // 6
</pre>
<p>Of course, we can do better! Let's create a general function compose:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const compose = (...fns) =&gt; x =&gt; fns.reduceRight((y, f) =&gt; f(y), x);

const incAndDouble2 = compose(double, inc);

incAndDouble2(2); // 6
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the functions are applied from bottom-to-top as in the definition <code>(f&nbsp;&sdot;&nbsp;g)(x)&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(g(x))</code>. It means, first <code>g(x)</code> is applied and, then, the output is used as the input for <code>f()</code>. If we want a composition applying from top-to-bottom, we can do it: this kind of composition is called a <em>pipe</em>:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const pipe = (...fns) =&gt; x =&gt; fns.reduce((y, f) =&gt; f(y), x);

const incAndDouble3 = pipe(inc, double);

incAndDouble3(2); // 6
</pre>

<h2>Transducer Composition</h2>
<p>Probably the most useful is the mapping transducer. Let's define it:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const map = f =&gt; step =&gt; (a, c) =&gt; step(a, f(c));
</pre>
<p>The <code>map</code> takes two curried parameters <code>f</code> and <code>step</code>. <code>f</code> is a mapping function and <code>step</code> is a reducer function to calculate (reduce) the result. We can peep at it with the following code:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const testReducer = map(double)((a, c)&nbsp;=&gt; console.log(c));
[1,2,3].reduce(testReducer, 0); // prints 2, 4, 6 into the console
</pre>
<p>Now we can use the composite function from above:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const incAndDouble4 = compose(map(inc), map(double));

const concat = (a, c) =&gt; a.concat([c]);

const&nbsp;incAndDoubleReducer = incAndDouble4(concat);

[1,2,3].reduce(incAndDoubleReducer, []); // 4, 6, 8
</pre>
<p>If you paid attention you maybe noticed one thing. Compare these two lines:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const incAndDouble2 = compose(double, inc);
const incAndDouble4 = compose(map(inc), map(double));
</pre>
<p>We didn't redefine the compose function, the result remains the same, but the order of functions for the composition is the other way around. How is this possible? Let's analyse it...</p>
<p>The composite function is pretty straight-forward: it takes a function from bottom-to-top, applies it (first to the init value <code>x</code>) and uses the output as the input for the next function. The difference between <code>double</code> and <code>map(double)</code> is, that <code>map(double)</code> returns a transducer function, not a scalar value as <code>double</code> does. This transducer function takes a parameter <code>step</code>, which is a reducer. It means, <code>f(y)</code> from the compose function is <code>transducer(reducer)</code>; after evaluating it we get a <code>step</code> reducer function, which is then used as a new input <code>y</code> for the next transducer. Well, it means those two lines above define different kinds of function:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const incAndDouble2 = compose(double, inc); &nbsp;// function (x) =&gt; x
const incAndDouble4 = compose(map(inc), map(double)); &nbsp;// transducer (reducer) =&gt; reducer
</pre>
<p>Composition uses reducing in the bottom-to-top direction (<code>reduceRight</code>), the result of the composition is the top-most transducer function which contains the next (to-bottom direction) transducer's result reducer (in the <code>step</code> parameter). This next reducer is applied after the current reduction (mapping) is applied.</p>
<p>We can write this particular composition function as:</p>
<pre class="brush: javascript">const compose = (...reducers) =&gt; initReducer =&gt; reducers.reduceRight(
&nbsp; &nbsp; (previousReducer, currectTransducer) =&gt; currectTransducer(previousReducer), initReducer);
</pre>
<p>Each reducer in the composition has a reference to the previous reducer (<code>step</code>). The final reduction starts with the top-most reducer which applies its functionality (mapping) and then executes the referenced reducer (<code>step(...)</code>). This brings the reducing in the opposite direction (top-to-bottom) from the transducers composition (bottom-to-top).</p>
<p>We can break down our example execution as following:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/Transducing.png" alt="Transducing" /></p>
<p>As we can see, the result reducer applies functions in order: <code>inc</code>, then <code>double</code>, then <code>concat</code>. As expected.</p>
<p>Neat.</p>
<p>Happy transducing!</p>
