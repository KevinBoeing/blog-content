<h2>Fill up the lexicon</h2>
<p>First we need to define the lexicon of pairs term-explanation from which the application shall test us.</p>
<p> We can do it in two easy ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>by the form in the bottom part of the application frame,</li>
<li>putting the pairs as <strong>two lines of a text file</strong> (first line the term, second the explanation and so on) and import them via the application menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>The lexicon can be as well exported into a text file via the application menu, this will create two lines of text for each term-explanation pair. The file can be then edited and imported into the application and vise versa.</p>
<h2>Test your memory!</h2>
<p>The application will show you first the term and let you think. You can let show the explanation. Then you can move forward by clicking the green or red button if you had known the term or not.</p>
<p>The application will server the most difficult words with priority. </p>
<h3>Structure your tests</h3>
<p>The application uses the file named <strong><code>lexicon.dat</code></strong> in the working directory as the storage. You can backup your lexicons in files and just rename the file with the demanding lexicon to <code>lexicon.dat</code> to push it into the application (the application has to be restarted to load the new lexicon file).</p>
<p>Or you can use export - import functions to achieve this. But be aware that doing this you will loose you success-fail results!</p>
<h2>Get it</h2>
<p>You can download the <a href="/storage/memory-examiner-1.0.jar">executable JAR archive</a> and run it by the command (if your OS is not configured to run JAR files on the JRE implicitly):</p>
<p><code>java -jar memory-examiner-1.0.jar</code></p>
<p> <br /></p>
<p>And because this is a blog about programming, you can see the <a href="/storage/memory-examiner-1.0-sources.jar">source codes</a> as well.</p>
