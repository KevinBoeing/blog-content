    <p>Is it even possible to roll microservices back?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>When thinking about a deployment strategy for microservices-based systems, it is natural to consider a <em>rollback</em>. Before looking for a technical solution, let's discuss this idea conceptually.</p>

<h2>Microservices</h2>
<p>One of a plenty definitions of a microservice is an <strong>independently deployable</strong> component. This says actually a pretty lot. To understand this definition we have to go back to the very first motivation for the microservices design pattern: <em>We want to deliver our product as soon as possible</em>. A microservice could be in hands of one team and have a completely different and unsynchronous delivery process. A team developing service A doesn't want to be bothered by waiting for the next release of a service B if it doen't need its new functionality. Service A could be deployed into the production once a day and the service B once a month.</p>
<p>For all this to be possible we have to follow a few basic principles, especially the most important one in our context: <strong>No Breaking Changes</strong>. We may find the same principle under different names like <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/03/10-lessons-from-10-years-of-aws.html" target="_blank">"APIs are forever"</a> etc., but the idea is the same.</p>

<h2>No Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>How does this principle makes the microservices deployment independent? Let's consider two services, A and B. B is calling A via A's API. In the time of development of a version v1 of the service B, there is a released API of service A in the version v1. So the service B v1 makes its call against the service A v1:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/rollback-1.png" width="70%" alt="Service Bv1 calls Av1" /></p>

<p>During the development of service B v1 a new version of service A - v2 - was released. An additional endpoint was added, but it's okay for the service B because A's API was not broken (in other words, A v2 is compatible with A v1). Actually, so far there are no breaking changes the service B doesn't care which newly realeased version of the service A is talking to:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/rollback-2.png" width="70%" alt="Service Bv1 calls Av2" /></p>

<h2>What about Rollbacks?</h2>
<p>Now consider that the service B in some future version (let's say v2) is using an endpoint of the service A added in its release v2:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/rollback-3.png" width="70%" alt="Service Bv2 calls Av2" /></p>

<p>After some time the developers of service A find an error in the v2. They decide to rollback to the previous version (v1). What happens to the system? Service B stops working because it keeps calling the endpoint of service A v2 which doesn't exist anymore. The <strong>rollback to a previous version is a potential breaking change</strong>:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttulka/blog-assets/master/rollback-4.png" width="70%" alt="Service Bv2 calls Av1" /></p>

<p>Because it can introduce a breaking change as the rest of the system depends on the current API a <strong>rollback should be avoided in microservices-based systems</strong>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As long as we can't rollback microservices, we have to find a confident way how to deploy them into production. There are a lot of good practices like separated deployment stages (development, testing, QA, ...), testing in a production-like environment, blue-green and canary deployment, and so on.</p>
<p>It's also very important to resist the temptation of hot fixing a bug directly in the production environment. We alywas have to adapt the continuous-delivery principles: Every change, bug-fixes included, must be properly built and tested thru the standard deployment process (delivery pipeline).</p>
<p>Microservices are living organisms and should be treated like that.</p>

<p>Happy deploying!</p>
